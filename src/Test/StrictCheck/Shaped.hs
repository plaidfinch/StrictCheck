{-| This module defines the 'Shaped' typeclass, which is used to generically
    manipulate values as fixed-points of higher-order functors in order to
    analyze their structure, e.g. while observing evaluation.

    If you just care about testing the strictness of functions over datatypes
    which are already instances of @Shaped@, you don't need to use this module.

    __Important note:__ To define new instances of 'Shaped' for types which
    implement 'GHC.Generic', __an empty instance will suffice__, as all the
    methods of 'Shaped' can be filled in by generic implementations. For
    example:

    > import GHC.Generics as GHC
    > import Generics.SOP as SOP
    >
    > data D = C deriving (GHC.Generic)
    >
    > instance SOP.Generic D
    > instance SOP.HasDatatypeInfo D
    >
    > instance Shaped D

    Using the @DeriveAnyClass@ extension, this can be shortened to one line:

    > data D = C deriving (GHC.Generic, SOP.Generic, SOP.HasDatatypeInfo, Shaped)

    Manual instances of 'Shaped' are necessary for types which do not or cannot
    implement GHC's @Generic@ typeclass, such as existential types, abstract
    types, and GADTs.

    This module is heavily based upon the approach in "Data.Functor.Foldable",
    which in turn is modeled after the paper "Functional Programming with
    Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire" (1991) by Erik Meijer, Maarten
    Fokkinga and Ross Paterson. If you don't yet understand recursion schemes
    and want to understand this module, it's probably a good idea to familiarize
    yourself with "Data.Functor.Foldable" before diving into this higher-order
    generalization.

-- | When a type @a@ is @Shaped@, we know how to convert it into a

-- (the "shape of @a@ parameterized by @f@") is structurally identical to the
-- topmost structure of @a@, but with @f@ wrapped around any subfields of @a@.
--
-- Note that this is /not/ a recursive representation! The functor @f@ in
-- question wraps the original type of the field and /not/ a @Shape@ of that
-- field.
--
-- For instance, the @Shape@ of @Either a b@ might be:
--
-- > data EitherShape a b f
-- >   = LeftShape  (f a)
-- >   | RightShape (f b)
-- >
-- > instance Shaped (Either a b) where
