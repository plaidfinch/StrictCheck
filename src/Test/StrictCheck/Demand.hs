{-| A 'Demand' on some value of type @T@ is shaped like a @T@, but possibly
    truncated, to represent partial evaluation. This module defines the type of
    demands, and functions to manipulate them for the purpose of constructing
    demand specifications.

    A demand for some type @T@ can be represented one of two interconvertible
    ways:

    * explicitly, as a recursively interleaved @Shape@ of @T@
    * implicitly, as a value of @T@ with specially-tagged bottom values
      which represent un-evaluated portions of that value

   The explicit representation is useful for writing traversals and other such
   manipulations of demand values, while the implicit representation can prove
   convenient for writing demand specifications. The implicit representation is
   the default when writing specifications, but through the use of 'toDemand'
   and 'fromDemand', either representation can be used wherever it is most
   appropriate.

--------------------------------------------------------

-- | A @Thunk a@ is either an @a@ or a @Thunk@
--
-- When we interleave this type into the @Shape@ of some type, we get the type
-- of demands on that type.
--
-- @Thunk a@ is isomorphic to a (strict) @Maybe a@.

-- | A @Demand@ on some type @a@ is the same shape as that original @a@, but with
-- possible @Thunk@s interleaved into it
type Demand
  = (%) Thunk

-- | A @PosDemand@ is a "strictly positive" demand, i.e. one where the topmost
-- level of the demanded value has definitely been forced
--
-- This is the one-level unwrapping of @Demand@, and is useful to express some
-- invariants in specifications

-- Shrinking demands --
-----------------------

-- | Shrink a non-zero demand (analogous to QuickCheck's @shrink@)
--
-- While QuickCheck's typical @shrink@ instances reduce the size of a value by
-- slicing off the top-most structure, @shrinkDemand@ reduces the size of a
-- demand by pruning it's deepest /leaves/. This ensures that all resultant
-- shrunken demands are strict sub-demands of the original.

------------------------------------
-- Evaluating demands as contexts --
------------------------------------

-- | Evaluate some value of type @a@ to the degree specified by the given demand
--
-- If the demand and the value diverge (they pick a different side of a sum),
-- evaluation will stop at this point. Usually, @evaluateDemand@ is only called
-- on demands which are known to be structurally-compatible with the
-- accompanying value, although nothing really goes wrong if this is not true.

-- Pretty-printing demands --
-----------------------------

-- | A very general 'showsPrec' style function for printing demands
--
-- @showPrettyFieldThunkS q t p r@ returns a function @(String -> String)@ which
-- appends its input to a pretty-printed representation of a demand.
--
-- Specifically:
-- * @q@ is a boolean flag determining if names should be printed
-- as qualified
-- * @t@ is a string which is to be printed when a thunk is encountered
-- * @p@ is the precedence context of this function call
-- * @r@ is the 'Rendered Thunk' representing some demand
--
-- This is very general, but we expose it in its complexity just in case some
-- person wants to build a different pretty-printer.
--
-- The precedence-aware pretty-printing algorithm used here is adapted from a
-- solution given by Brian Huffman on StackOverflow:
-- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27471937/43639618#43639618>.
