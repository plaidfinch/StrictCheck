{-| The @match@ function in the typeclass 'Test.StrictCheck.Shaped.Shaped'
    allows you to uniformly operate over all the fields in a given piece of
    data--for instance, consuming them, iterating over them, counting them,
    etc. This module defines a uniform representation to allow this to work.

    This is in the nitty-gritty of how StrictCheck works: you do not need to
    understand this in order to use StrictCheck, unless you need to declare
    custom instances of @Shaped@ for a type not supported by StrictCheck's
    generics mechanism (i.e. GADTs, existential types, abstract types).

import Generics.SOP

-- | The @Flattened@ type contains all the fields in a piece of data
-- (represented as an n-ary product 'NP' from "Generics.SOP"), paired with a way
-- to re-assemble them into a value of the original datatype.
--
-- @Flattened d f xs@ can be read as "some value of type @d f@, which has been
-- separated into an n-ary product @NP f xs@ and a function which can reconstruct
-- a value @d h@ for any @h@, given an n-ary product with matching field types
-- to the one contained here.
--
-- Pay attention to the kinds! @d :: (Type -> Type) -> Type@, @f :: Type -> Type@,
-- and @xs :: [Type]@.
--
-- For types which are literally a collection of fields with no extra
-- information, the reconstruction function merely converts the given list of
-- fields back into a value of the original type. For types which contain extra
-- information in their values (beyond what StrictCheck considers fields), this
-- function should contain that information, and re-attach it to the field
-- values it receives.
