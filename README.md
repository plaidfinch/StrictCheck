# StrictCheck: Keep Your Laziness In Check
  
[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/StrictCheck.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/StrictCheck)

StrictCheck is a property-based random testing framework for
observing, specifying, and testing the strictness behaviors of Haskell
functions. Strictness behavior is traditionally considered a non-functional
property; StrictCheck allows it to be tested as if it were one, by reifying
demands on data structures so they can be manipulated and examined within
Haskell.

For details, see the library on Hackage: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/StrictCheck>.
