  # StrictCheck: Keep Your Laziness In Check
  
  StrictCheck is a property-based random testing framework for
  observing, specifying, and testing the strictness behaviors of Haskell
  functions. Strictness behavior is traditionally considered a non-functional
  property; StrictCheck allows it to be tested as if it were one, by reifying
  demands on data structures so they can be manipulated and examined within
  Haskell.
  
  For details, see the library on Hackage: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/StrictCheck>.
